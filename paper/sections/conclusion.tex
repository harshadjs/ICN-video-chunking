\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we examined the effect of different chunk lengths on
Video QOE metrics as well as cache and server performance. Many
researchers in this area assume a particular chunk size and base their
research on that. Our simulations clearly suggested that it is
important to take into account the size of chunks in any upcoming
research in information centric networks. Our key findings about chunk
sizes are: 1) Higher chunk sizes tend to have lower PIT overhead and
lower cache performance win 2) Lower chunk sizes, on the other hand,
have lower PIT overhead and higher cache performance win. If a network
administrator values server resources over user quality of experience,
he or she could use smaller chunk sizes. However, if they value the
performance of the network even at the expense of lower server saving,
they should use a bigger chunk size.

Based on these findings, we believe that future research in this space
should definitely take into account the performance of different
workloads for various chunk sizes.
