\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we examined the effect of different chunk lengths on
Video QOE metrics as well as cache and server performance. Many
researchers in this area assume a particular chunk size and base their
research on that. Our simulations clearly suggested that it is
important to take into account the size of chunks in any upcoming
research in information centric networks. Our key findings about chunk
sizes are: 1) Higher chunk sizes tend to have lower PIT overhead and
lower cache performance win 2) Lower chunk sizes, on the other hand,
have lower PIT overhead and lower cache performance. Based on these
findings, we believe that future research in this space would evaluate
performance of different workloads for various chunk sizes.
