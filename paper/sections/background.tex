\section{Background} \label{sec:background}
In order to better introduce the question we are trying to answer, we will talk
about our work in relation to two previously published papers. The first is
called ``Developing a Predictive Model of Quality of Experience for Internet
Video'' \cite{1}. This paper redefines the metrics used to predict the quality of
experience that a user experiences depending on a number of measurements of
video streaming. Although not directly related to caching, we used this work to
determine which metrics we would try to measure to make sure our results
translated to effects on the user.

The second paper is called ``Trace-Driven Analysis of ICN Caching Algorithms on
Video-on-Demand Workloads'' \cite{2}. This work is actually where we got the idea for
our own project. We chose to explore one of the few aspects of caching that the
paper did not take into account.
