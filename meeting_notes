-cash hit rate
    can derive from log file

-server load reduction
-user experience e.g. average latency of chunks
-congestion reduction -- number of requests traversing each edge between routers

user quality of experience metrics
-buffering ratio -> how much time the user spends buffering i.e. waiting for
chunks, assume 
-bit rate
-start up time -> latency to first chunk
